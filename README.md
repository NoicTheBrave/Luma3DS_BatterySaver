# Luma3DS_BatterySaver
Project is supposed to be able to use Luma3DS's Rosalina to monitor the 3DS' battery to allow the system to automatically shutdown after the battery drops below a predetermined % or voltage. 

This is my first time experimenting with Luma3DS and first attempt at anything homebrew I have made myself for the 3DS. Wish me luck :) 

Goal: 
* Save my 3DS's internal clock
  * Since the 3ds does not have a CMOS battery, the 3ds' time is tied to the system battery. B/c of this when the handheld dies, the system time/date is reset.
  * This becomes an issue for users who use frequently use the Streetpass feature of the 3DS. If the user forgets to charge their 3ds, recharges it and forgets to reset the date and time, inaccurate Streetpass data will be registered on the handheld as to when it was recieved (I believe)
  * It is also DAMN ANNOYING TO HAVE TO RESET THE DATE AND TIME OF THE 3DS EVERY TIME I FORGET TO CHARGE IT LIKE ***BRO*** - There are games that rely on that information (system date/time) & I HATE going thru and changing it everytime I wanna play Tomadachi Life :)
